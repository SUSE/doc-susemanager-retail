  With amazing voluntary commitment, the developers of Linux cooperate on a
  global scale to promote the development of Linux. We thank them for their
  efforts&mdash;this distribution would not exist without them. Furthermore,
  we thank Frank Zappa and Pawar. A special thanks, of course, goes to Linus
  Torvalds.
