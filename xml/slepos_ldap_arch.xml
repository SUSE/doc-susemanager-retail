 <title>LDAP Architecture and Synchronization</title>
 <para> The central database is located on the &admserv; and acts as the
  main LDAP database and LDAP replication provider. Since &slepos; 11, each
  &branchserv; has its own LDAP replica for independent use, thus saving
  network bandwidth and maintaining all functionality if the connection to
  the &admserv; is lost. </para>
 <para> For security and management reasons, only a part of the central
  LDAP database is replicated on each &branchserv;: the section common to
  all &branchserv;s (read-only access) and the organizational unit branch
  in which the current &branchserv; is configured (read-write access). </para>
 <sect2>
  <title>&admserv; LDAP</title>
  <para> In the &admserv; LDAP the &slepos; 11 system is configured. The
   LDAP directory must be initialized before any &branchserv; installation
   or deployment. The &admserv; LDAP is managed by the
    <command>posAdmin</command> tool. </para>
  <sect3>
   <title>&admserv; Access Control List</title>
   <para> &slepos; 11 introduces Access Control List (ACL) to: </para>
   <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
    <listitem>
     <para> protect the &admserv; LDAP directory against unauthorized
      access (credentials no longer distributed to &branchserv;s), </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> grant write access for each &branchserv; to its subtree and
      restrict other parts of the directory. </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para> ACL is automatically managed by <command>posAdmin</command> when
    a new <systemitem>scLocation</systemitem> object is created or deleted.
    Default ACRs (Access Control Rules) restraining anonymous users are
    activated when &admserv; is initialized by the
     <command>posInitAdminServer</command> command. </para>
   <para> ACL is stored in the LDAP dynamic <literal>cn=config</literal>
    database and in the <filename>/etc/openldap/acl.ldif</filename>
    file. The file is used to preserve ACL during the OpenLDAP server
    restart. This file should be kept secure. </para>
   <para> Each &branchserv; has only access to its respective LDAP subtree.
    For example, if the <systemitem>scLocation</systemitem>
    <systemitem>dn</systemitem> of the &branchserv; is
     <literal>&dnbranch;</literal>, the &branchserv; only has read and
    write access to the <literal>&dnbranch;</literal> subtree. </para>
   <para> In previous versions, the &branchserv; had read and write access
    to the whole organizational unit (<systemitem>ou</systemitem>).
    <!--FIXME v rozporu s predchozi stati?--> LDAP replication is directly
    affected by this change. Now only the relevant subtree is replicated
    (replication of general read-only items is preserved (for example
     <literal>cn=global,&dnorg;</literal> and
     <literal>cn=standards,&dnorg;</literal>). &branchserv; may see other
    organizational units but sees them empty. </para>
   <sect4>
    <title>Manual Configuration of ACL</title>
    <para> The Access Control List <systemitem>default</systemitem> is
     automatically generated during <command>posInitAdminServer</command>
     execution. The rule definition starts with: </para>
    <screen>#STARTACL-default</screen>
    <para> The following lines grant read access to the LDAP subtree
      <literal>cn=global,&dnorg;</literal> for any authenthicated user and
     blocks others: </para>
    <screen>access to dn.subtree="cn=global,&dnorg;"
 by users read
 by anonymous none</screen>
    <para> This grants read access to any LDAP
      <systemitem>scHardware</systemitem> object class for any
     authenthicated user and blocks others: </para>
    <screen>access to filter="(objectClass=scHardware)"
 by users read
 by anonymous none</screen>
    <para> This grants read access to LDAP root for authenthicated users
     and blocks others: </para>
    <screen>access to dn.base="&dnorg;"
 by users read
 by anonymous none</screen>
    <para> posAdmin ends the ACR named "default" with: </para>
    <screen>#ENDACL-default</screen>
    <para> When the &branchserv;
     <systemitem>scLocation</systemitem> LDAP object is added by posAdmin,
     the following ACR is added, with the appropriate marker starting the
     ACR definition for &branchserv; located in the organizational unit
      <literal>&dnunit;</literal>: </para>
    <screen>#STARTACL-&dnunit;</screen>
    <para> The following lines grant write access to the LDAP subtree
      <literal>&dnunit;</literal> for &branchserv;s authenthicated against
     the <systemitem>scLocation</systemitem> object
      <literal>&dnbranch;</literal> and no access for other users (except
     the &admserv; root user). It allows LDAP the compare method for
     anonymous users so they can authenticate themselves. </para>
    <screen>access to dn.subtree="&dnunit;"
 by dn.base="&dnbranch;" write
 by users none
 by anonymous auth</screen>
    <para> The ACR ends with the marker corresponding with the
     &branchserv;: </para>
    <screen>#ENDACL-&dnunit;</screen>
    <para> A typical problem with ACL is that despite wrong settings LDAP
     Bind is successful, LDAP filter is valid, but the LDAP search returns
     an empty result. </para>
    <para> To identify the problematic ACL, search for the <literal>access
      to</literal> keyword followed by your search base DN or the DN under
     which your base DN is located. Remove that entry. </para>
    <para> Remember to restart the LDAP server after modifying the
      <filename>/etc/openldap/acl.ldif</filename> file. </para>
    <warning>
     <title>Non-Persistent Changes</title>
     <para> If you are configuring LDAP server via the cn=config
      configuration interface, remember these changes are not persistent in
      current configuration. </para>

  <sect3>
   <title>Synchronization Provider</title>
   <para> The &admserv; LDAP performs a crucial role in the &slepos;
    central management. To support the &branchserv;'s independent
    opperation when a network connection to the &admserv; LDAP is
    unavailable, the &admserv; provides LDAP synchronization. The &admserv;
    LDAP provides each &branchserv; LDAP with its respective content,
    according to the defined ACL, via the LDAP SyncProv protocol. </para>
   <para> The synchronization provider is activated by the following
    statements in the <filename>slapd.conf</filename> file: </para>
   <screen># sycnrepl provider configuration
overlay syncprov
syncprov-checkpoint 100 5
syncprov-sessionlog 100</screen>
   <para> Provider activation is done by the <literal>overlay
     syncprov</literal> statement. </para>
   <para>
    <literal>syncprov-checkpoint 100 5</literal> forces the LDAP server to
    store the current contextCSN (value where the actual database state is
    stored) in the database after 100 operations or 5 minutes, whichever
    occurs first. This reduces the time and processing power needed to
    restart the LDAP server after a crash. </para>
   <para> The <literal>syncprov-sessionlog 100</literal> statement tells
    the LDAP server to store up to 100 write operations in the dedicated
    log, which is then used to simplify the determining LDAP control
    attributes. It is used primarily in <literal>refreshOnly</literal>
    synchronization mode, which is used while switching &branchserv; from
    online to offline mode. </para>
  </sect3>
 </sect2>
 <sect2>
  <title>&branchserv; LDAP</title>
  <para>The &branchserv; LDAP is an exact replica of
    <literal>cn=global</literal> and the &branchserv;'s organizational unit
   subtree. Its purpose is to lower the network bandwidth usage by LDAP
   search and read operations and to support the &branchserv;'s ability to
   work without a network connection to the &admserv;. </para>
  <sect3>
   <title>&branchserv; Access Control List</title>
   <para> The &branchserv; ACL is simple. It restricts access to the
    database to the &branchserv; root DN (as root DN can access everything
    anyway). </para>
   <para> The &branchserv; ACL is stored in OpenLDAP's
     <filename>slapd.conf</filename> (default path
     <filename>/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</filename>): </para>
   <screen>
access to dn.subtree="&dnorg;"
by dn.base="&dnbranch;" write
by users none
by anonymous auth</screen>
   <para> This rule is applied to the main &branchserv; database. There are
    two additional global rules to provide general compatibility with some
    LDAP browsers, mainly GQ, and speed up the start of the LDAP server: </para>
   <screen>
access to dn="" by * read
access to dn.base="cn=Subschema" by * read
</screen>
   <para> The &branchserv; ACL should not require any maintenance and is
    only changed during &branchserv; reinitialization. </para>
   <note>
    <title>Modifying the Global LDAP Section on &branchserv;</title>
    <para> Using the &slepos; administrator user name and password on the
     &branchserv; is unsupported because of the nature of LDAP subsystem
     organization. The only way to modify the
      <systemitem>cn=global</systemitem> LDAP subtree from the &branchserv;
     is to use remote SSH to the &admserv;. </para>
   </note>
  </sect3>
  <sect3>
   <title>&branchserv; Synchronization</title>
   <para> Compared to the &admserv; synchronization controls, the
    &branchserv; synchronization settings are much more complex. Every
    synchronization issue should be solvable on the &branchserv; side. </para>
   <!--
''Please note, that synchronization is not started by default during
BranchServer`s LDAP start. Instead, posASWatch daemon is used to determine
whether and when should be synchronization started. To properly understand
whole synchronization concept, see
[[Slepos-ldap#LDAP_Synchronization_and_Offline_LDAP|LDAP Synchronization and
Offline LDAP]].''
-->
   <para> The &branchserv; synchronization consists of two steps: </para>
   <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
    <listitem>
     <para> SyncRepl consumer, </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> LDAP chaining. </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <sect4>
    <title>SyncRepl consumer</title>
    <para> SyncRepl (Synchronized Replication) is the main database update
     mechanism. It continually asks the &admserv; LDAP for changes and
     updates the &branchserv; LDAP accordingly as the "RefreshAndPersist"
     LDAP synchronization mode is used. </para>
    <para> SyncRepl is usually controlled by the
      <command>posASWatch</command> script, but with the
      <command>pos</command> command, manual control is also possible:
      <command>pos status</command> displays current synchronization
     status, <command>pos start</command> starts synchronization, and
      <command>pos stop</command> stops synchronization. </para>
    <para> For debugging purposes, the following command prints the current
     SyncRepl state: </para>
    <screen>ldapsearch -x -LLL -h localhost -D cn=admin,cn=config -w <replaceable>password</replaceable> -b cn=config '(objectClass=*)' 'olcSyncrepl'</screen>
    <para> The typical setup with SSL looks like this: </para>
    <screen>
{0}rid=000 provider="ldaps://adminserver.mycompany.us"
    bindmethod=simple
    timeout=0
    network-timeout=0
    binddn="&dnbranch;"
    credentials="secret"
    starttls=no
    tls_cacert=/etc/SLEPOS/keys/certs/ca.crt
    searchbase="&dnorg;"
    scope=sub
    type=refreshAndPersist
    retry="2 +"</screen>
    <para> If SSL is not used, the
      <literal>tls_cacert=/etc/SLEPOS/keys/certs/ca.crt</literal> line is
     not present. </para>
   </sect4>
   <sect4>
    <title>Chaining</title>
    <para> Chaining with the updateRef directive is the second part of the
     &admserv; LDAP and the &branchserv; LDAP collaboration. It handles
     updates in the opposite direction to that of the SyncRepl consumer
     when &branchserv; is in online mode. </para>
    <para> When a write request arrives on the &branchserv; LDAP and the
     &branchserv; is in online mode, the request is forwarded using LDAP
     updateRef and chaining the overlay to the &admserv; LDAP, where the
     actual request is executed. The UpdateRef directive is set up and
     maintained by the <command>posASWatch</command> daemon together with
     SyncRepl. Chaining settings are persistent and stored in the
     &branchserv;'s <filename>slapd.conf</filename>: </para>
    <screen>
overlay                    chain
chain-uri                  "ldaps://adminserver.mycompany.us"
chain-idassert-bind        bindmethod="simple"
                           binddn="&dnbranch;"
                           credentials="secret"
                           mode="self"
chain-return-error         TRUE
</screen>
    <para> These settings reflect the typical &slepos; chain overlay setup. </para>
    <para> When the &branchserv; is in offline mode, updateRef and Syncrepl
     are deactivated by posASWatch. </para>
