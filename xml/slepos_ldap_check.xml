 <title>LDAP Validation and Checking</title>

 <para>
  &slepos; contains LDAP validation and checking tools. Simple validation and
  checking is automatically performed during each <command>posAdmin</command>
  addition or modification call. Full validation is performed during &slepos; XML
  import or on demand via the following command:
 </para>

<screen>posAdmin --validate</screen>

 <para>
  There is an important difference between LDAP validation during the XML import
  and validation invoked by the <command>posAdmin --validate</command> command.
  If important LDAP objects are found missing during the XML import, the
  missing objects are reported, but the import continues without a failure. In
  contrast, calling <command>posAdmin --validate</command> returns an error the
  first time a file is missing and stops validation.
 </para>

 <para>
  Additionally, XML and LDIF files can be validated against the &slepos;
  database. LDIF files can be validated using the following command:
 </para>

<screen>posAdmin --validateLDIF --file <replaceable>filename</replaceable></screen>

 <para>
  XML can be validated using the following command:
 </para>

<screen>posAdmin --validateXML --file <replaceable>filename</replaceable></screen>
