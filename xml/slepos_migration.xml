 <title>Migrating to &slepos; 3.1</title>
 <info/>
 <para>
  This section covers the supported migration and upgrading scenario.

 <sect1 xml:id="migr11sp2tosp3">
  <title>Migrating from &slepos-old; 11 SP3 to &slepos; 3.1</title>

  <para>
   The migration consist of three steps:
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Collect the old data from the &admserv;.
    </para>
    <para>
     Use the &slepos; backup tool <command>slepos_backup_data.sh</command> to
     collect the old configuration, LDAP and images. To use this tool, make
     sure you have installed the <systemitem>POS_Migration</systemitem> package
     from &slepos; 11 SP3 on your old system:
    </para>
<screen>/usr/lib/SLEPOS/migration/slepos_backup_data.sh -f <replaceable>backup_file_name.tgz</replaceable></screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Migrate the data to the &slepos; 3.1 &admserv;
    </para>
    <para>
     Transfer the collected backup to your &slepos; 3.1 server (make sure the
     <systemitem>POS_Migration</systemitem> package is installed) and call
     <command>slepos_migrate.sh</command> tool:
    </para>
<screen>
 /usr/lib/SLEPOS/migration/slepos_migrate.sh --deploy_type=AS -f <replaceable>backup_file_name.tgz</replaceable>
</screen>
    <para>
     After the migration is completed, call <command>posAdmin
     --validate</command> to make sure the LDAP database was correctly
     imported.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Reinitialize the &branchserv;s
    </para>
    <para>
     &branchserv;s are not migrated, they are always initialized as new.
     After a &branchserv; is (re)initialized, call <command>pos
     dump-all</command> to regenerate configuration files for cash registers.
    </para>
   </step>
  </procedure>

<!--  <note> 
   <title> &slepos-old; 11 SP2 Images</title>
   <para>It is possible to use &slepos-old; 11 SP2 images with &slepos-old; 11 SP3
    servers.</para>

<sect2>
  <title>Upgrading &slepos-old; 11 SP3 to &slepos; 3.1</title>

  <para>
   If you want to upgrade &slepos-old; 11 at the same time as &sls; 11 SP3, check the
   <guimenu>Include Add-On Product from Separate Media</guimenu> option during
   selection of the installation mode. You will be asked to select the &slepos; 11
   SP3 installation source.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you want to upgrade &slepos-old; 11 after the &sls; 11 SP3 upgrade, use the &yast;
   <guimenu>Add-On Products</guimenu> module and add &slepos; 3.1 as an add-on.
   Network upgrade is not supported in this scenario and results in
   installation failure during the second installation stage because of DNS
   resolving failure. You can work around this limitation by switching to a
   second console
   (<keycombo><keycap function="control"/><keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo>), logging in
   as root and starting DNS server manually with the <command>rcnamed
   start</command> command.
  </para>

  <para>
   During the upgrade installation, you will be asked to select a &slepos; pattern. If you do not want to change the installed pattern, click
   <guimenu>Next</guimenu>.
  </para>
  <sect3>
   <title>&slepos; Configuration After Upgrade</title>
   <para>
    The &admserv; does not need to be configured after upgrading. Only
    theÂ &branchserv; needs reconfiguration after an upgrade. The
    non-interactive reconfiguration is triggered via the
    <command>posInitBranchserver -r -n</command> command.
